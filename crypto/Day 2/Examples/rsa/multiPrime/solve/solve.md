Since the modulus is composed of many primes that are not extremely large we attempt to factor here. Upon factoring into primes we can simply utilize the Euler totient and its multiplicative property to obtain $\phi(N)$. $\phi(N) = \phi(p)\; \phi(q )\; \phi(r)\; \phi(s)$

After obtaining phi(N) we can calculate the private key, d, as the multiplicative modular inverse of the public key, e, under the modulus phi(N).
