# Crypto lessons for the 2020 bootcamp

## Topic Overview:
- Classical Crypto 
- Modular Arithmetic
- Block/Stream Ciphers
- RSA
- Brief overview of harder stuff like ECC/PQ

Going to stress emphasis on understanding setup of cryptosystem and 
the modular arithmetic or logical equations relating operations.

Give insight to 1-2 easy attacks on these systems.

## Classical Crypto

## Modular Arithmetic
- XOR w/ known plaintext and short pad
- Single byte pad
- Show example of proper OTP and difficulty in finding original m value
- Diffie-Hellman Exchange Example

## Block/Stream Ciphers
- Oracle Attack
- Bit Flips 

## RSA
- Factorization of the modulus
- Small public key that causes the message to not wrap around the modulus
- 

## Day 1
